# Paths

The last example used paths, let's take another look at paths because there is a lot you can do with these. Often we draw data in the form of line graphs you can use a path to do this. 

For this example, you will use the `precipitation.csv`. This file contains rainfall amounts for the years 1998 to 2017. The data is for a month by state in India. 

This CSV file contains lost of data, almost 6000 lines! We will need to be more careful about what we display. 

In this example you will create a line graph. Read more about line graphs here: https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/line_graph.html

## Setup

Start a new HTML document. 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <title>Using Paths</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <svg id="svg" width="600" height="400"></svg>

  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
  <script>
  // Your code here
  </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's put the chart in the center of the screen. You can apply styles to your SVG element.

Add these styles to the head of the document. 

```HTML
<style>
  /* Put the box in the center of the page */
  body, html {
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  #svg {
    border: 1px solid;
  }
</style>
```

Doesn't look like much yet. You should see a box with a black border in the center of the page. 

Copy the `precipitation.csv` file into the folder where you are working.

**Challenge:** 

Try loading `precipitation.csv` with D3 on your own. You can log the data to the console to test it. 

## Loading data

In this step, you'll load the data. 

In the previous example, we loaded the data with the d3 CSV loader and all of our code was in an anonymous function. This time let's use a named function. 

Our setup will look like this: 

```JS 
d3.csv('precipitation.csv')
  .then(handleData)

function handleData(data) {
  // draw stuff here
}
```

It might even make more sense to arrange it like this: 

```JS 
function handleData(data) {
  // draw stuff here
}

d3.csv('precipitation.csv')
  .then(handleData)
```

After D3 loads the CSV data we will handle it with the `handleData()` function. 

## Filtering the data

The precipitation data is almost 6000 lines long. That would be a lot to process and display. Since the data is arranged by state, month and year we can choose a more reasonable selection of the data to display. 

For example, we can display just precipitation for only a single state, or a single year for all states. Or any other selection you can think of. 

Let's try by state. To start we need a function to filter the data by state. 

Add this function: 

```JS
function getDataForState(data, state) {
  const arr = data
    .filter(d => d.state === state)
    .filter(d => !isNaN(d.precipitation))
    .map(d => {
      d.precipitation = parseFloat(d.precipitation)
      return d
    })
  return arr
}
```

This function takes an array and a state string. 

It filters all of the data returning only the objects where `d.state === state`. 

There may be some missing data, so next it filters out any records that may be missing precipitation data. 

Last it maps all of the values and converts them to floats. The data from the CSV will be strings. This step will avoid math issues. 

You can test it like this: 

```JS
function handleData(data) {
  // draw stuff here
  console.log(getDataForState(data, 'SE'))
}
```

This should provide a list of 239 floating-point numbers that represent rainfall in inches for each month. 

Some of the state codes you can use are: 

BA, RR, SE, AL, TO, GO, PI, MG, PR, MA, AP, RJ, AC, AM, DF, PE, CE, PA, MT, PB, RS, RN, SP, ES, SC

The data is from India. 

## Making Scales 

To map the precipitation data onto the screen we need to create some scales. What we're doing is creating some helper functions that will map the source data from their domain of inches to our display domain measured in pixels. 

Everything from here is going to happen inside the `handleData()` function. 

Get the precipitation data for `BA` (I'm not sure what state this is)

```JS
function handleData(data) {
  const baData = getDataForState(data, 'BA')

}
```

### x scale 

Now create an x scale for that data. This needs to divide the number of values over the width of the SVG viewport. In this case, we can just input the numbers.

```JS
function handleData(data) {
  const baData = getDataForState(data, 'BA')
  // x scale 
  const xscale = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([0, baData.length]) // number of values
    .range([0, 600]) // width of #svg
}
```

This scale should spread the values horizontally based on their index. The extents are 0 to the length of the array in this case. 

### y scale

Now you need a y scale. This needs to map the rainfall value in inches to the height of our SVG viewport in pixels. 

Try it on your own. Use the `d3.extents()` method to get the extent of the precipitation from your `baData`. Then make a scale that maps this to the height of the screen.

```JS
const percipitationExtents = d3.extent(baData, d => d.precipitation)
const yscale = d3.scaleLinear()
  .domain(percipitationExtents)
  .range([0, 400])
```

## Line Generator

Time to make a line generator. If you recall from the previous tutorial you used `d3.line()` to generate the data needed to draw a path. In that example, there were only a few points. This time you have 239 points! you will need a better solution. 

Create a line generator function! 

Let's review how the SVG path works again. The code below generates a heart-shaped path.

```SVG
<path d="M 10,30
  A 20,20 0,0,1 50,30
  A 20,20 0,0,1 90,30
  Q 90,60 50,90
  Q 10,60 10,30 z"/>
```

A path element has a `d` attribute that contains a series of number pairs that represent an x and y position. Sometimes there will be a letter. This is a modifier that describes what type of point something is or how to get to that point. M is a move to, A is an arc, Q is a quadratic curve, Z means to close the path. In the case of the quadratic curve, there are two pairs of points. The second pair determines the curvature of the line. 

This would be difficult to do by hand. Luckily D3 has features built into the `d3.line()` method that makes making this type of path description easier.

`d3.line()` provides the following methods:

- `x()` - sets the x position of a point on the line
- `y()` - sets the y position of a point on the line
- `curve()` - determines what type of curve is used for this line segment

Define a line generator below your scales: 

```JS
// line generator
const linegen = d3.line() // create a line generator
  .x((d, i) => xscale(i)) // map the x to the index
  .y(d => yscale(d.precipitation)) // map y to percipitation
  .curve(d3.curveLinear) // apply a curve type
```

Notice that your line will define an x function using the index `i` and the `xScale()` function, and the y function using the `precipitation` value and the `yScale()` function. For the curve, we are using `d3.curveLinear` which tells D3 that we want straight lines between segments. 

## Drawing the line

Now it's time to make an SVG drawing. The code here is a little different from the code we saw earlier.

```JS
d3.select('#svg')
  .append('path') // append a path
  .attr('d', linegen(baData)) // generate a line
  .attr('stroke-width', 3)
  .attr('stroke', 'cornflowerblue')
  .attr('fill', 'none')
```

What happened here? 

First, you selected the SVG element.

Next, you appended a path. In this case, there will only be a single path. Your data will be expressed as points on the path. 

**NOTE!** Since you aren't making a new element for each piece of data we didn't set `.data()` and you didn't call `.enter()`! You are only making a single path element. 

Next, you set the `d` attribute for the path. To get the path data you use the `linegen()` function you created earlier and pass your dataset in. This function returns a value that expresses the line. 

The next three lines set the style of the line, including the stroke-width, stroke (color), and fill style. 

It should look something like this so far: 

![example-1](images/example-1.png)

This is pretty good but the data is going all the way to the edges of the SVG viewport. In some cases, you might want this. Sometimes you might want a little margin. You may even want to limit the vertical height for other reasons. 

Try adjusting the x and y scales to position and fit the drawing in the window a little better. 

To do this you're going to adjust the range of the scale, NOT the domain! The domain hasn't change. 

Move the left and right in by adjusting the range of the `xscale`:

```JS
// X Scale
const xscale = d3.scaleLinear()
  .domain([0, baData.length])
  .range([40, 560]) // Change the range!
```

Notice the edges move inward. Our minimum x is now 40 and the maximum is 560. 

Do the same to the `yscale`:

```JS
// Y Scale
const yscale = d3.scaleLinear()
  .domain(percipitationExtents)
  .range([40, 360]) // Change the range!
```

Now the top comes down 40 and moves up 40 from the bottom. 

I just realized our rainfall values are expressed upside down! ðŸ˜± 

The lowest values for rainfall are at the top of the graph and high numbers are at the bottom! 

You can fix this by inverting the range! 

```JS
.range([360, 40]) // invert the range
```

Your graph should look something like this: 

![example-2](images/example-2.png)

## Challenges 

**Challenge 1:** Edit the style of the line

**Challenge 2:** Display the data for a different state. 

**Challenge 3:** Add a second path that displays a second state. The idea is to display to line charts one on top of the other. 

## Conclusion 

In this tutorial you learned to work with paths generating a line from data.
